Task 1. Write a Python function that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Use `numpy.vectorize` to apply this function to an array of temperatures: `[32, 68, 100, 212, 77]`. 
   - Formula: $C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}$

---

Task 2. Create a custom function that takes two arguments: a number and a power. Use `numpy.vectorize` to calculate the power for each pair of numbers in two arrays: `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Task 3. Solve the system of equations using `numpy`:
   $$
   4x + 5y + 6z = 7 \\
   3x - y + z = 4 \\
   2x + y - 2z = 5
   $$

Task 4. Given the electrical circuit equations below, solve for $I_1, I_2, I_3$ (currents in the branches):
   $$
   10I_1 - 2I_2 + 3I_3 = 12 \\
   -2I_1 + 8I_2 - I_3 = -5 \\
   3I_1 - I_2 + 6I_3 = 15
   $$
